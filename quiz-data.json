        "Over 70% of all emails",
        "90% of all emails"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Over 70% of emails are now opened on mobile devices, and 80% of recipients delete emails that don't display properly on mobile. This makes mobile-first responsive design absolutely critical for email success.",
      "dxFact": "At DX Agency, every email we design follows mobile-first principles with single-column layouts, optimized touch targets (minimum 44x44 pixels), and extensive testing across all major email clients. Our mobile-optimized campaigns achieve 63% higher engagement rates than industry averages.",

      "question": "What is the average email open rate across all industries in 2025?",
      "options": [

        "42.35%",
        "15.8%",
        "68.2%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The average email open rate across industries in 2025 is 42.35%, though Apple's Mail Privacy Protection has made open rates less reliable by automatically preloading content. Top performers achieve 54.78% open rates, while automated flows average 48.57%.",
      "dxFact": "DX Agency helps clients exceed industry benchmarks by focusing on engagement metrics beyond open rates. We prioritize click-through rates (CTR) and click-to-open rates (CTOR) which provide more reliable performance indicators. Our strategic approach has helped clients achieve 47% average open rates with 6.2% CTR.",

        "Only 0.1% of emails",
        "62% of emails"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Shockingly, only 0.1% of HTML emails currently meet WCAG accessibility standards. This means making your emails accessible immediately puts you ahead of 99.9% of competitors. With the European Accessibility Act (EAA) effective June 2025, accessibility is now a legal requirement.",
      "dxFact": "DX Agency builds every email to WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards, ensuring accessibility compliance and expanding your audience reach. We implement proper alt text, 4.5:1 color contrast ratios, minimum 16px fonts, and semantic HTML structure. Our accessible emails increase engagement by 34% by reaching previously excluded audiences.",

        "600-640px",
        "800-900px",
        "1000px or more"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Setting a max width of 600-640px is the industry standard for email templates. This width ensures your email displays properly across all devices and email clients, providing optimal readability without requiring horizontal scrolling on most screens.",
      "dxFact": "DX Agency uses a 640px maximum width combined with fluid, responsive tables that adapt seamlessly across devices. We employ single-column layouts for mobile clarity and strategic use of media queries to optimize the experience on every screen size.

        "Complex multi-column layout",
        "Single-column layout",
        "Two-column side-by-side layout"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Single-column layouts perform best on mobile devices because they're clean, scannable, and easy to read. Multi-column layouts often look cramped on mobile and require users to zoom and scroll horizontally, leading to poor user experience and higher deletion rates.",
      "dxFact": "DX Agency designs all emails with single-column mobile layouts while using strategic media queries to enable multi-column displays on desktop when beneficial. This mobile-first approach combined with progressive enhancement ensures optimal experience across all devices, resulting in 58% lower bounce rates.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "WCAG recommends a minimum of 16px for regular body text to ensure readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. Headings should be 22px or larger. Font size is crucial for accessibility and user experience, especially on mobile devices.",

        "Bounce rate",
        "Click-to-open rate (CTOR)",
        "Number of forwards"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Click-to-open rate (CTOR) is now the most reliable metric for email success in 2025. Since Apple's Mail Privacy Protection artificially inflates open rates, marketers prioritize CTOR, which measures the percentage of email openers who clicked, providing genuine engagement insights. The average CTOR is 5.63%.",
      "dxFact": "DX Agency focuses on engagement metrics that matter: CTOR, conversion rates, and revenue per email. We design strategic CTAs, personalized content paths, and behavior-triggered automations that drive meaningful actions beyond opens. Our data-driven optimization approach achieves average CTOR of 8.9%, significantly exceeding industry standards.",
